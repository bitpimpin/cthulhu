# Roadmap

Here's the current plan for Cthulhu. The current version is still pre 0.1.

* [ ] [0.1] interpreter and most prominent API calls available
* [ ] [0.2] create an actual JavaScript API and not simply global methods
* [ ] [0.3] blocking calls/background processing
* [ ] [0.4] functions with variable argument number
* [ ] [0.5] return type to redis should be specific and not string
* [ ] [0.6] support for generic LUA style calls
* [ ] [0.7] more Redis API if needed
